# hello-world

Hi there! 

Im studying Computer Forensics and Security and am a local to the Bournemouth area. I like to occasionaly game and more recently have found a huge interest for sailing/ boating. I look forward for my time at BU, gaining valuable information and meeting new people along the way!
